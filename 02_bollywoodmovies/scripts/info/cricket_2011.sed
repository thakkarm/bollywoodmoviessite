This one was epically for the little master <A ALT="" TITLE="Sachin Tendulkar" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/sports/cricket/sachin_tendulkar/cricket_sachin_tendulkar.html">Sachin Tendulkar</A> who has gotten many of the records in the world of cricket but wanted to win the world cup to add a nice cherry on top of his brilliant career. Going into the world cup India was favored to win it all and now they have behind great and timely batting and a great bowling attack. <BR>Today's match started off with the coin being have to be tossed twice because for some reason the first time no one heard the call from the Sri Lankan's captain, Kumar Sangakkara and had to retoss the coin. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat. They started off slow with losing WU Tharanga with the total at 17 in over 6, but then build a nice total with Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and a brilliant 103 by Mahela Jayawardene and put up a nice and winnable total of 274 for India to chase. <BR>The Indian inning started off to a rough start with Lasith Malinga stricking early to take Virender Sehwag out on just the 2nd bowl of the inning and then followed up taking out the little master <A ALT="" TITLE="Sachin Tendulkar" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/sports/cricket/sachin_tendulkar/cricket_sachin_tendulkar.html">Sachin Tendulkar</A> in over 6, with India total at 31. The task to reach 275 was already massive and now with India's opening batsmen back in the club house the task looked even more difficult but the Indian youth showed the world the class of batsmen they are with <A ALT="" TITLE="Gautam Gambhir" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/sports/cricket/gautam_gambhir/cricket_gautam_gambhir.html">Gautam Gambhir</A> and Virat Kohli taking the Indian total to 114 when he Virat was dismissed by Tillakaratne Dilshan. At this point to everyone's surprise India's captin <A ALT="" TITLE="Mahendra Singh Dhoni" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/sports/cricket/mahendra_singh_dhoni/cricket_mahendra_singh_dhoni.html">Mahendra Singh Dhoni</A> stepped onto the field instead of <A ALT="" TITLE="Yuvraj Singh" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/sports/cricket/yuvraj_singh/cricket_yuvraj_singh.html">Yuvraj Singh</A> . Dhoni and Gautam carried the total to a nice total of 223 in over 41 when Gautam was bowled out after a much needed and timely 97 to help set the stage for Dhoni and man of the tournment Yuvraj to carry team India to a historic victory. Dhoni locked in the victory with a captains knock of 91 runs off 79 balls not out. Dhoni ended the innings with a massive 6 to win the world cup. Dhoni's world cup winning monster six will be remembered for decades to come by the Indian all over the world. At the end of the day patiences and persistences paid off for team India. <BR> <b>BollywoodMovies.us</b> team would like to congratulate Team India on the World Cup win. <BR> Now India will have to defend the World Cup title at the 2015 ICC World Cup tournament in New Zealand and Austilia. <BR> Team India expresses itself moments after the historic 2011 World Cup Win:<BR> Virat Kohli: This is for the people of India, this for all their support. <BR> Zaheer Khan: Yes, it's been amazing, you know. Dream come true. <BR> Sachin Tendulkar: Couldn't have asked for something bigger than this. I think winning the World Cup is the biggest thing and I am experiencing it. It's the proudest moment of my life. <BR> On finally winning it after 6 WCs: Yes, it's never too late, like they say. And thanks to all my teammates and support staff and without such fabulous performances and such consistency, it would never have happened. Did he cry? Yes, I was emotional. They were happy tears, so I wouldn't mind crying. <BR> Gautam Gambhir: Hasn't sunk in yet. I think all the guys must have felt about 2007 (world cup early exit). That was a nightmare. This is a dream. All credit to Sachin Tendulkar and the team. <BR> Yuvraj Singh: It is unbelievable. There was the under 19 World Cup win, the T20 win, but this is the most special one for the whole of India. For Sachin, for the whole team. I dedicate this to my gurujis, Guru Ram Singh and Guru Arjen Singh, to my mother, my teammates. Last time (in the 2003 World Cup final) we were chasing 358 and made a lot of mistakes and we didn't want to do that again. We saved a lot of runs in the field and then Gauti and MS batted outstandingly. We've taken the pressure pretty brilliantly, we batted like champions.<BR> Harbhajan Singh: I'm feeling very emotional, hence the tears. I can't explain the feeling. I have been part of three World Cups and the dream has finally come true. This Cup is for the people of India. <BR> <A HREF="#" onclick="ImagePopup('http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pictures/2011_icc_world_cup_india_01.jpg',500,500);return false;"> <IMG SRC="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pics/2011_icc_world_cup_india_01.jpg" ALT="2011 ICC World Cup India" TITLE="2011 ICC World Cup India" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"> </A> <A HREF="#" onclick="ImagePopup('http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pictures/2011_icc_world_cup_india_02.jpg',500,500);return false;"> <IMG SRC="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pics/2011_icc_world_cup_india_02.jpg" ALT="2011 ICC World Cup India" TITLE="2011 ICC World Cup India" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"> </A> <A HREF="#" onclick="ImagePopup('http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pictures/2011_icc_world_cup_india_03.jpg',500,500);return false;"> <IMG SRC="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pics/2011_icc_world_cup_india_03.jpg" ALT="2011 ICC World Cup India" TITLE="2011 ICC World Cup India" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"> </A> <A HREF="#" onclick="ImagePopup('http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pictures/2011_icc_world_cup_india_04.jpg',500,500);return false;"> <IMG SRC="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pics/2011_icc_world_cup_india_04.jpg" ALT="2011 ICC World Cup India" TITLE="2011 ICC World Cup India" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"> </A> <A HREF="#" onclick="ImagePopup('http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pictures/2011_icc_world_cup_india_05.jpg',500,500);return false;"> <IMG SRC="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pics/2011_icc_world_cup_india_05.jpg" ALT="2011 ICC World Cup India" TITLE="2011 ICC World Cup India" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"> </A> <A HREF="#" onclick="ImagePopup('http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pictures/2011_icc_world_cup_india_06.jpg',500,500);return false;"> <IMG SRC="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pics/2011_icc_world_cup_india_06.jpg" ALT="2011 ICC World Cup India" TITLE="2011 ICC World Cup India" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"> </A> <A HREF="#" onclick="ImagePopup('http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pictures/2011_icc_world_cup_india_07.jpg',500,500);return false;"> <IMG SRC="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pics/2011_icc_world_cup_india_07.jpg" ALT="2011 ICC World Cup India" TITLE="2011 ICC World Cup India" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"> </A> <A HREF="#" onclick="ImagePopup('http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pictures/2011_icc_world_cup_india_08.jpg',500,500);return false;"> <IMG SRC="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pics/2011_icc_world_cup_india_08.jpg" ALT="2011 ICC World Cup India" TITLE="2011 ICC World Cup India" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"> </A> <A HREF="#" onclick="ImagePopup('http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pictures/2011_icc_world_cup_india_09.jpg',500,500);return false;"> <IMG SRC="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/info/pics/2011_icc_world_cup_india_09.jpg" ALT="2011 ICC World Cup India" TITLE="2011 ICC World Cup India" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"> </A> </TD> </TR> <!-- STORY_END --> <!-- STORY_START --> <tr HEIGHT=25 bgcolor="white"> <td WIDTH=100% align="left" valign="center" colspan=2> <A ALT="" TITLE="2011 ICC Cricket World Cup: Ireland Beats England" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/news/2011/02_28_2011.html">03/02/2011</A>: <br> Ireland shocks England with a stunning win behind the bat of Kevin O'Brien.

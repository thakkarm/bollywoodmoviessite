India's spinner <A ALT="" TITLE="Harbhajan Singh" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/sports/cricket/harbhajan_singh/cricket_harbhajan_singh.html">Harbhajan Singh</A> grabbed three wickets, while teenaged paceman <A ALT="" TITLE="Ishant Sharma" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/sports/cricket/ishant_sharma/cricket_ishant_sharma.html">Ishant Sharma</A> also took three wickets to bowl out South Africa for 265 on the first day of the test match. India's captin <A ALT="" TITLE="Harbhajan Singh" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/sports/cricket/anil_kumble/cricket_anil_kumble.html">Harbhajan Singh</A> was ruled out due to injury, and <A ALT="" TITLE="Mahendra Singh Dhoni" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/sports/cricket/mahendra_singh_dhoni/cricket_mahendra_singh_dhoni.html">Mahendra Singh Dhoni</A> became the first Indian 'keeper to lead in tests'. South Africa skipper Graeme Smith scored with 69. The wicket is making it harder for the batsmen to handle the spin and will test the Indian team. <hr size="1" width="100%"> </td> </tr> <!-- STORY_END -->|g

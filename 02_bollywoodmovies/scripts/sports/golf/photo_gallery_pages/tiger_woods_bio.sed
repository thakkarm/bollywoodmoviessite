The conclusion provided a very climatic ending with Tiger Woods and Rocco Mediate in a head on playoff after the tie during the regular match. Now two days later, Tiger has announced that he will undergo reconstructive surgery to the anterior cruciate ligament on his left knee, this will require rehabilitation on a double stress fracture of his left tibia and hence Tiger will miss the 2008 seasons. This will include such matches like September's Ryder Cup, Open Championship at Birkdale and PGA Championship in Michigan in August. <hr size="1" width="100%"> </td> </tr> <!-- STORY_END -->|g

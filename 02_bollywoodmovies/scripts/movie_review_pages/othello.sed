s|TAG_MAIN_REVIEW_1|Omkara is a movie that is probably not for everyone, with its U.P. dialect and the dark and disturbing theme. The director is well known as a storyteller and Vishal does well here. The story really being to pick up in the second hour. The cast has given great performance in the movie and the director and writers have given a great script. <A ALT="" TITLE="Saif Ali Khan" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actor/saif_ali_khan/bollywood_saif_ali_khan.html">Saif Ali Khan</A> really steals the show with his new look and his overall body language and behavior. <A ALT="" TITLE="Kareena Kapoor" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actress/kareena_kapoor/bollywood_kareena_kapoor.html">Kareena Kapoor</A> also delivers an award worthy performance. Overall the film is great from the story and direction point of view but let see what the audience has to say about that.|g

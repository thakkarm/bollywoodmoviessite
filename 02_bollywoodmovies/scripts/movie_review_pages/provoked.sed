s|TAG_MAIN_SYNOPSIS_1|Provoked is based on the real life story of a woman NRI Kiran Ahluwalia who showed exemplary courage after suffering physical, mental and sexual torture for ten long years. <br> Then, she thought of making her husband Deepak realize at least for once the suffering she has been passing through. She planned to burn the feet of her husband so that the latter is unable to run after her and thus torture her. <br> She tried to put fire to his bed while he was asleep at night. Since Deepak got up, Kiran threw the burning matchstick on Deepak's bed. This injured Deepak seriously and he died after ten days of hospitalization. <br> Kiran was arrested for murdering her husband. The court ordered life imprisonment for her, ignoring the husband's torture of Kiran for ten years. <br> An NGO working among South Asian women named South hall Black Sisters, appealed to the court for revision of the order. The court reduced her sentence to three years and three months. Kiran was released from the prison onSeptember 25th, 1992.<br><hr size="1" width="100%">|g

s|TAG_MAIN_REVIEW_1|The subject of the movie is something that probably happens all over the world, but the screenplay lacks the power it needs to touch the audience. The film will do well for a particular audience type, but will have a hard time to bring in the big audience.|g

s|TAG_MAIN_SYNOPSIS_1|The film is highly anticipated as it marks the return of Kajol, after four years from the film industry. It also features the pairing with Aamir Khan, for the first time, whom she worked with in Ishq (1997) directed by Indra Kumar and starring Ajay Devgan and Juhi Chawla. The film is about an heart throbbing tale of a terrorist in love with a blind girl about traumatizing conflict between Kashmiri militants and Indian Army.|g
#
s|TAG_MAIN_REVIEW_1|Fanaa is a fine movie to come out of the Yash Raj camp. It may also be a great movie to come out of Bollywood in a long time. The film is a return of Kajol and also stars Aamir Khan with a lot of high expectations. The film seems to have been well scripted and has been well directed. It is great to see Kajol back after a long break and this role ranks one of her best and strongest. The film is directed by Kunal Kohli of Hum Tum and he establishes himself as a master storyteller with Fanaa. The movie is worth the price of the ticket and even the extra snack and popcorn. Enjoy the movie, we may not see such a great movie for a long time?|g

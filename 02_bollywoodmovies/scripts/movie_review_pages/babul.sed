s|TAG_MAIN_REVIEW_1|The story by itself does not have much to offer the audience, but the big star cast and return of Amitabh and Hema Malini. The story is about father-son. The movie is very soft until the interval when it turns when Avinash dies. Then there are a lot of tears for the next part of the film. The movie is entertaining but it moves slowly. The movie will do well in the first week and has fallen short of the expectation.|g

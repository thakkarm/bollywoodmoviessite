s|TAG_MAIN_SYNOPSIS_1|Jodhaa Akbar is a love story between the Mughal emperor, Akbar (<A ALT="" TITLE="Hrithik Roshan" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actor/hrithik_roshan/bollywood_hrithik_roshan.html">Hrithik Roshan</A>), and a Rajput princess, Jodhaa (<A ALT="" TITLE="Aishwarya Rai Bachchan" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actress/aishwarya_rai/bollywood_aishwarya_rai.html">Aishwarya Rai Bachchan</A>) during the sixteenth century. With great power and balance of strenght and wit, Emperor Akbar soon extended his empire to extend from Afghanistan to the Bay of Bengal, and from the Himalayas to the Godavari River. And on the way made friends with the Rajputs, the most belligerent Hindus. But unware of the storm that was going to be brought into his life when he married Jodhaa, Rajput princess. Which started Akbar on the new adventure of his life, the adventure of true love.|g

s|TAG_MAIN_REVIEW_1|Another great film from Ashutosh, following his previous successful movies like Swades and Lagaan. This is Ashutosh's biggest film so far with a strong star cast, a well written screenplay and great music by the master musician AR Rahman. <BR> The movie contains many great scene and interactions between the protagonist couple. Both Hrithik and Aishwarya are perfect for the role Akbar and Jodhaa respectively. This may be the most Some memorable scenes includes the sword fight between the couple, when Akbar catches Jodhaa sight transfixed on his bare torso, then when the emperor tames a wild elephant, one-on-one combat scene in the climax. <BR> The film also have been very well shoot by cinematographer Kiran Deohans, which can be seeing in the battle scenes and the visualization of the songs Khwaja mere khwaja and Azeem-o-shaan-shahenshah. <BR> There have reports that the movie is not true to history, but if you go and see the movie for a Bollywood love story, then you will be pleasantly surprised. A must see movie for 2008. It's a big budget movie and the elaborate sets, locations and customs’ shows were the money was spent. The movie may be a little long for the current times, but it's a movie that is enjoyable and a worth watch.|g

s|TAG_MAIN_SYNOPSIS_1|The story is about the drug trading between Asia and Europe. Don, is running the gang. Don is captured and replaced by a look alike named Vijay to infiltrates the cartel, which he does. But during a raid the only person that know he is not the real Don is killed and from then on, Vijay is on the lookout for the one last piece of evidence that can get him out of the mess. He get this help from Roma (<A ALT="" TITLE="Priyanka Chopra" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actress/priyanka_chopra/bollywood_priyanka_chopra.html">Priyanka Chopra</A>) and Jasjit (<A ALT="" TITLE="Arjun Rampal" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actor/arjun_rampal/bollywood_arjun_rampal.html">Arjun Rampal</A>). |g

s|TAG_MAIN_REVIEW_1|The movie is a remake of the hit movie Don starring <A ALT="" TITLE="Amitabh Bachchan" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actor/amitabh_bachchan/bollywood_amitabh_bachchan.html">Amitabh Bachchan</A>. It is always a big risk to remake a movie and doing so for a Amitabh Bachchan makes it that much harder. The movie starts with really fast then moves at a sluggish pace at regular intervals. The movie is filled with twist and turns and no one ever seems to be whom they say they are. This version is more polished and had better stunts and better visual effects but lacks the story to hold the viewers. Farhan has made a great ending and twist to the movie, and is probably sure to comeback with a Don 2?  Besides <A ALT="" TITLE="Shahrukh Khan (SRK)" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actor/shahrukh_khan/bollywood_shahrukh_khan.html">Shahrukh Khan (SRK)</A>, all other characters are under used and do not really show up in the movie. The movie will do well becuase of Shah Rukh Khan, Diwali and Idd.|g

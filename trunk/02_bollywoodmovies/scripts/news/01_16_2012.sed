An elderly woman instructed the first time father through the process of the delivery. The baby came out safely, one young girl offered her coat to keep the baby warm as the biggest concern for officials was the baby's warmth. What another miraculous event in the world! </TD> </TR> <!-- STORY_END -->|g

It was a down to the wire high scoring match in which both teams had their ups and downs throughout the game. Both teams scored two TDs in the final 4 minutes, including the game winner by Alex Smith to Vernon Davis in the final grueling seconds of the game. Vernon Davis had a career day, 180 yards and two important touchdowns. Drew Brees had 462 yards and 4 touchdowns but he wasn't enough to overcome a stingy 49ers front seven as he was sacked 3 times. <hr size="1" width="100%"> </td> </tr> <!-- STORY_END -->|g

The service will allow the users to store their data online and allow access to that data from anywhere, thus reducing the need for a PC with large hard drives. This will turn the users into one more thing that they use via the web, they already access such services as e-mail, photo storage via the web. If the GDrive is really what people make it out to be, they it could turn the PC into a device to access the web. The GDrive concept is being described as "cloud computing", where the web rather than the hard drive is used as the medium to store information. The big question will be are people willing to trust their personnel data to Google. Only time will tell if such a service is announced and then used by the people in a safe manner. <hr size="1" width="100%"> </td> </tr> <!-- MONEY_NEWS_STORY_END -->|g

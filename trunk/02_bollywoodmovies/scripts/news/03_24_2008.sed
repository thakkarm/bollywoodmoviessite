The Blackberry service is currently being used by over four lakh users and stopping the service will not allow these users to access email in form of SMS. The service is currently provided by AirTel, Reliance and Vodafone. The major issue seems to be that the encryption process applied to email utilizes servers that are located in Russia, United States or Canada, but no servers in India. The Indian security agencies feels that messages through the service cannot be accessed by local security authorities and hence may affect the national security of India. <hr size="1" width="100%"> </td> </tr> <!-- INDIA_STORY_END -->|g

The movie is produced by UTV production and was announced at the Cannes Film Festival on May 13, 2011. Manish Malhotra will style Aishwarya in the film. <BR> Here is the synopsis released along with the press note at Cannes:<BR> "The film is based on the life and times of a superstar heroine from Bollywood. It is said to be an entertaining, daring, emotional, shocking, glamorous, scandalous behind the scenes account of the reality behind the world of glitz and glamor that the film stars inhabit. For a country obsessed with films and film stars, Heroine will take audiences on a voyeuristic journey to see what really goes on behind the closed doors of make up rooms and vanity vans. It will give them a chance to go beyond the gorgeous smiles and politically correct quotes, to see what really happens in the lives of India's sweethearts - The sniping & the politics, the secrets & the lies, the incredible highs of fame & the lonely depths of failure." Bhandarkar considers this film to be his magnum opus.<br><hr size="1" width="100%"> <b>Preity Zinta to play gangster in next film?</b> <br> Date: <A ALT="" TITLE="Preity Zinta to play gangster in next film?"

s|TAG_MAIN_REVIEW_1|One of the movie awaited movie of the year is here, and its was worth the wait. As always a movie with <A ALT="" TITLE="Aamir Khan" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actor/aamir_khan/bollywood_aamir_khan.html">Aamir Khan</A> bring along great expectations. The Tamil version Ghajini had been a big hit and hence it was also dubbed in Telugu version. The movie is almost 3 hours long, but you will not be looking at the watch anything during the movie since it's full of drama and action that will keep you hooked to the screen. The movie at times is violent, which is required per the screenplay and story. Aamir has given a great performance and is able to adapt his role between the two characters. <A ALT="" TITLE="Asin Thottumkal" HREF="http://www.bollywoodmovies.us/actress/asin_thottumkal/bollywood_asin_thottumkal.html">Asin Thottumkal</A> has given a great performance as well and will be around Bollywood for a longtime. The movie should do well with the holiday season, but its not a family film. |g

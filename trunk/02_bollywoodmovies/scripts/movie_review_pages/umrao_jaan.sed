s|TAG_MAIN_REVIEW_1|It's always tough to do a remake of a successful film. The audience is going to watch with high expectations and hence the director has to come up with some unusual plot to draw and hold the audience, like it was done with Don. J.P. Dutta is a fine director and a master storyteller. He has captured the bygone era beautifully (19th century Lucknow) and stamp of a master storyteller is visible in crucial scenes but that’s not enough for the audience. The movie is to long (3 hour + duration), has too many songs and does not have the plot to hold the audience. <BR> The movie has a weak beginning and maybe a good second, but the weak start will loose the audience. Aishwarya Rai looks beautiful and has performed great. Abhishek Bachchan has also done good acting but is capable of more.|g

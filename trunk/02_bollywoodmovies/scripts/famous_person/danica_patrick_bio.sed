Danica is a race car driver and probably was not favoured to win any race in which mostly men are race car drivers. Now she has proved her critics wrong by capturing first place in Sunday’s Indy 300 race in Motegi, Japan. Danica was the first female to hold a lead in the Indianapolis 500 three years ago and has kept herself in the new since then. She is backed by sponsors like Motorola, XM Satellite Radio and Go Daddy.|g
